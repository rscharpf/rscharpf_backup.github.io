{"name":"Robert B. Scharpf Research Page ","tagline":"Research Page","body":"### Research Overview\r\nI develop statistical methods and software for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data, including methods for estimating cross-study differential gene expression in mRNA microarrays, methods for detecting structural variants from array- and sequence-based platforms.  I also develop methods and software for preprocessing array and sequence platforms to remove batch effects and other technical sources of variation.  Most of our software is available from Bioconductor, with developmental versions available from github.\r\n\r\n### Bioconductor Packages\r\n* oligoClasses: infrastructure for crlmm and oligo packages \r\n* crlmm:  Methods for calling genotypes and copy number for Affymetrix and Illumina genotyping platforms\r\n* SNPchip: A few plotting utilities for log R ratios / BAFs; chromosome idiograms\r\n* XDE: A Bayesian Hierarchical model for cross-study differential gene expression\r\n* MinimumDistance: Methods for calling de novo copy number variants in case-parent trios\r\n* ArrayTV: Software for removing genomic waves from marker-level estimates of copy number such as log R ratios derived Affymetrix or Illumina genotyping arrays\r\n\r\nThe above packages can be installed by\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ source(\"http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\n$ pkgs <- c(\"oligoClasses, \"crlmm\", \"XDE\", \"MinimumDistance\", \"ArrayTV\", \"SNPchip\")\r\n$ biocLite(pkgs) \r\n```\r\n\r\n### GitHub Packages\r\nThe developmental versions of these packages (use at your own risk) are available on github can be installed by\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n$ library(devtools)\r\n$ install_github(\"MinimumDistance\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote these packages are tested against the developmental version of R.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
